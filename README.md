# Neural-Style-Transfer
Source code for the student lecture "neural style transfer" as part of the "Artificial Intelligence" course at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

This repo bases on original Neural Style Transfer paper (Gatys et al. 2015): https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

## Examples
Style transfer allows us to create an image of certain thing (content image) with certain style (style image).
Check out how awesome it is!

## How to use
Code will create new folder for your content image, saves the final image, but also creates a gif file.

### Installation
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Use script
The configuration file is in the config folder. 
Key parameters are: content_img (image A) and style_img (image with reference style).
This repository uses a Hydra framework, so can modify this in default.yaml file itself, but also you can 
pass the parameters from command line for example:
```
python style_transfer.py style_img='examples/style/starry_night.jpg'
```
